#  How to Run (Frontend)
-  The code was implemented via Android Studio however you can use both Android Studio and VSCode to run. The application can run any version of the android.
-  The code that I have implemented is in the lib/main.dart file.

#  How to Run (Backend)
-  You can run it  with "python3 app.py" in the website folder.
-  I ran the code only using PyCharm but other IDE's would probably work as well.
-  Whichever you choose as IDE, you always have to download necessary packages
-  The necessary packages:
1) Flask
2) Flask-Python
3) Flask-Bcrypt
4) Flask-Cors
5) Flask-Login
6) Flask-Migrate
7) Flask-SQLAlchemy
8) bcrypt
9) psycopg2
